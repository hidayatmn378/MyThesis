abstract = {An updated global bathymetry and topography grid is presented using a spatial sampling interval of 15 arc sec. The bathymetry is produced using a combination of shipboard soundings and depths predicted using satellite altimetry. New data consists of >33.6 million multibeam and singlebeam measurements collated by several institutions, namely, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Geoscience Australia, Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. New altimetry data consists of 48, 14, and 12 months of retracked range measurements from Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, and Jason-2, respectively. With respect to SRTM15_PLUS (Olson et al.,), the inclusion of these new data results in a ∼1.4-km improvement in the minimum wavelength recovered for sea surface free-air gravity anomalies, a small increase in the accuracy of altimetrically derived predicted depths, and a 1.24% increase, from 9.60% to 10.84%, in the total area of ocean floor that is constrained by shipboard soundings at 15-arc sec resolution. Bathymetric grid cells constrained by satellite altimetry have estimated uncertainties of ±150 m in the deep oceans and ±180 m between coastlines and the continental rise. Onshore, topography data are sourced from previously published digital elevation models, predominately SRTM-CGIAR V4.1 between 60°N and 60°S. ArcticDEM is used above 60°N, while Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica is used below 62°S. Auxiliary grids illustrating shipboard data coverage, marine free-air gravity anomalies, and vertical gradient gradients are also provided in common data formats.},

abstract = {The impact of horizontal resolution (1/12° to 1/50°; 6 to 1.5 km at midlatitudes) on Gulf Stream separation, penetration, and variability is quantified in a series of identical North Atlantic experiments. The questions the authors seek to address are twofold: 1) Is the realism of the modeled solution increased as resolution is increased? 2) How robust is the modeled mesoscale and submesoscale eddy activity as a function of grid spacing and how representative is it of interior quasigeostrophic (QG) or surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence? This study shows that (i) the representation of Gulf Stream penetration and associated recirculating gyres shifts from unrealistic to realistic when the resolution is increased to 1/50° and when the nonlinear effects of the submesoscale eddies intensifies the midlatitude jet and increases its penetration eastward, (ii) the penetration into the deep ocean drastically increases with resolution and closely resembles the observations, and (iii) surface power spectra in the 70–250-km mesoscale range are independent of the horizontal resolution and of the latitude and are representative of 2D QG and SQG turbulence.},

Recent studies have predicted that energy equation in B{\"{o}}dewadt flow can have physically compatible solution only when disk is porous. We utilize the usual von-K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n variables to transform the governing equations of fluid motion and heat transfer (with variable properties) into self-similar differential equations. The final problem comprises of a parameter $\theta$e that measures the degree of dependence of fluid viscosity on temperature. A numerical approach is pursued to determine velocity components, wall stresses, temperature and heat transfer rate from the disk. Wall suction velocity is found to have a pivotal role on the solutions. The main outcome of the study is that fluid velocity and temperature around the disk are considerably altered by varying the parameter $\theta$e. The deviations of present results from those obtained with constant fluid properties are deliberated. Present results are in perfect agreement with the available literature in a limiting sense.},

abstract="The Seven Basic Equations represent the spatial and temporal dimensions of atmospheric motion, energy, and moisture, and are solved simultaneously in numerical weather prediction at many grid points in the atmosphere. The first three equations are collectively known as the Reynolds Equations of Motion. They solve for the time rate of change of wind speed in the west-to-east, south-to-north, and down-to-up direction at each grid point, as a function of the rate of advection and convection of wind, the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the impact of friction. The fourth is the Thermodynamic Energy Equation. It expresses the sum of the internal energy of the individual molecules comprising the atmosphere and the kinetic energy that drives the macro-scale motion of the atmosphere (i.e., the wind). The Moisture Conservation Equation states that the change in moisture content at a grid point is equal to the sum of the contribution of moisture via advection and the contribution via phase changes. The sixth equation is most commonly known as the Continuity Equation or Mass Conservation Equation, which computes the time rate of change of density as a function of density advection in the west-to-east, south-to-north, and down-to-up directions, respectively, and the velocity convergence/divergence in the same three directions. The final equation, the Equation of State for an Ideal Gas, is the ``glue'' that binds the other equations because it relates pressure, density (or its reciprocal, specific volume), and temperature. A few of the most commonly used numerical weather prediction models are reviewed.",

The method of characteristics (MOC) is applied for the analysis of two transient categories, where the governing one-dimensional, hyperbolic conservation equations are linearized and solved without neglecting any of their term. First, we present a parametric study of the pressurized flow encountered when pipelines are utilized for the transportation or the temporary storage of natural gas. The non-ideal compressibility of natural gas is included in the model and its impact on the thermo-hydraulic processes is elucidated. Second, we model the hydrodynamics of a pipeline whose downstream boundary is a periodic discharge rate. The results show that, in response to these boundary conditions, the pressure distribution in the pipeline also undergoes periodic variations. Furthermore, our simulation results confirm the usefulness of MOC for numerical simulation of flow phenomena in pipelines. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Airfoil is a part that influences the lifting force on the wing of the aircraft. Therefore, in this study should be conducted a study of three different forms of airfoil, about the behaviour of the fluid flow around it, numerically. The approach to fluid flow behaviour can be done using the Navier-Stokes equation. The airflow velocity around the airfoil is the fluid flow behaviour to be analysed, so the numerical solution can be obtained through Finite Element Method (FEM), then it is simulated with COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a software. Thus, the simulation results will show the interrelations between the angle of attack ($\alpha$) which varies with the maximum velocity distribution on each airfoil surface, and can be seen the most stable maximum velocity distribution among the three airfoil forms.},

Conceptual-level multidisciplinary design optimization is first performed to size the strut-braced-wing aircraft for a design mission similar to the Embraer E190-E2, with a design range of 3,100 nmi at a maximum capacity of 104 passengers, and a maximum payload of 30,200 lb. For direct performance comparisons, a conventional tube-and-wing regional jet is also sized and optimized based on the same reference aircraft. Gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization is then performed on wing-body-tail models of each aircraft, with the objective of drag minimization at cruise over a 500 nmi nominal mission. Design variables include twist and section shape degrees of freedom, which are realized through a free-form and axial deformation geometry control system, while nonlinear constraints include constant lift, zero pitching moment, minimum wing volume, and minimum maximum thickness-to-chord ratios. Results indicate that the optimizer is capable of mitigating shock formation, boundary-layer separation, and other flow interference effects from each wing design, including those within the wing-strut junction of the strut-braced wing. With current technology levels, the strut-braced-wing regional jet offers a 15.6% improvement in cruise lift-to-drag ratio over the equivalent conventional tube-and-wing aircraft, which translates to a 6.5% reduction in block fuel for the nominal mission.},

This paper deals with a numerical study on aerodynamic characteristics of the Horas Mesin USU. The numerical analyses are carried out by solving the governing equations using CFD FLUENT commercial code. The turbulent flow is closed using k-epsilon turbulence model. In the results, pathline, velocity vector and pressure distribution are plotted. By using the pressure distributions, drag and lift coefficients are calculated. In order to make a comparison, the aerodynamic characteristics of the present design are compared with commercial city car Ford-Fiesta. The averaged drag coefficients of Horas Mesin USU and Ford-Fiesta are 0.24320 and 0.29598, respectively. On the other hand, the averaged lift coefficients of the Horas Mesin USU and Ford-Fiesta are 0.03192202 and 0.09485621, respectively. This fact suggests that Ford-Fiesta has a better aerodynamic performance in comparison with Horas Mesin USU.

To predict the positive slope characteristics with an improved accuracy, a modified Partially-Averaged Navier-Stokes (MPANS) model is employed to capture the unstable physics in a pump-turbine. It is confirmed that the present numerical method predicts the positive slope characteristics in the pump-turbine fairly well compared with the experimental data. It is noted that at the drooping point of the performance curve (positive slope), there are three sets of rotating stall cells in the flow passages of both the guide vanes and stay vanes. In the guide vane region, the flow is completely shut off by the rotating stall, whereas in the stay vane region, the flow passage is partly blocked at the drooping point. The numerical results also reveal that the remarkable variation and high angle of attack (AOA) values upstream the leading edge of the guide vane contribute to the flow separation at the vane suction side and induce rotating stall in the flow passage within the positive slope region. Furthermore, the propagation of the rotating stall is depicted by both Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints: the rotating stall blocks the flow passage between two neighboring guide vanes and pushes the flow toward the leading edge of the subsequent guide vane. The rotating stall cell shifts along the rotational direction with a much lower frequency (0.146f n ) compared with the runner rotational frequency, f n .},

abstract = {In this paper, it was considered the numerical modeling of concentration propagation using solid barriers and porous barriers of different heights in an idealized urban canyon to protect nearby houses. To solve this problem, a modification of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations was used to take into account the properties of the porous medium. To validate the mathematical model, a test problem was solved without taking into account various barriers. After validation, the main problem was solved, describing the process of pollutants emission between houses when using different types of vegetation barriers (solid and porous). All the obtained numerical results were compared with each other using different types of vegetation barriers. And the optimal porosity properties and permeability coefficient for vegetation barriers have been determined. So, from the obtained results, it can be noted that when using a solid green fence with a height of 0.1H, it was found that the concentration indicator significantly decreased compared to the results without barriers. But when comparing the indicators of the spread of the concentration with porous barriers after a height of 0.1H, a tendency to decrease in the maximum concentration is noticeable, but the average value of the concentration almost does not change.},

@article{Kantha2019,
abstract = {Turbulent mixing in the upper layers of the northern Bay of Bengal is affected by a shallow layer overlying the saline waters of the Bay, which results from the huge influx of freshwater from major rivers draining the Indian subcontinent and from rainfall over the Bay during the summer monsoon. The resulting halocline inhibits wind-driven mixing in the upper layers. The brackish layer also alters the optical properties of the water column. Air-sea interaction in the Bay is expected to play a significant role in the intraseasonal variability of summer monsoons over the Indian subcontinent, and as such the sea surface temperature (SST) changes during the summer monsoon are of considerable scientific and societal importance. In this study, data from the heavily instrumented Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) mooring, deployed at 18oN, 89.5oE in the northern Bay from December 2014 to January 2016, are used to drive a one-dimensional mixing model, based on second moment closure model of turbulence, to explore the intra-annual variability in the upper layers. The model results highlight the importance of the optical properties of the upper layers (and hence the penetration of solar insolation in the water column), as well as the temperature and salinity in the upper layers prescribed at the start of the model simulation, in determining the SST in the Bay during the summer monsoon. The heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon also plays an important role. The interseasonal and intraseasonal variability in the upper layers of the Bay are contrasted with those in the Arabian Sea, by the use of the same model but driven by data from an earlier deployment of a WHOI mooring in the Arabian Sea at 15.5 oN, 61.5 oE from December 1994 to December 1995.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the cumulative impact of cyclonic (cold-core) and anticyclonic (warm-core) eddies on the distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Estimations of the ocean surface eddy features in the BoB using satellite-derived monthly, seasonal, and multi-year (2012–2016) datasets showed significant dominance of warm-core features over the cold-core ones. Multi-year monthly data of the BoB evidenced strikingly higher geographical area (%) for warm cores (av. 16.5 ± 5.5) compared to the cold-core features (av. 2 ± 1.2). The highest warm-core extent (%) was in May (av. 25.8 ± 1.4), followed by April (av. 22.6 ± 1.4), February (av. 19.5 ± 0.3) and March (av. 18.3 ± 0.9). Contrastingly, a relatively higher extent (%) of cold cores occurred in November (av. 3.9 ± 2.2), October (av. 3.78 ± 2.0), and December (av. 3.5 ± 2.1). The analysis also showed that the extreme oligotrophy of the study domain during the Pre-Monsoon (March-May) was caused by a robust, warm gyre. Upwelling and winter convection, which enhances phytoplankton biomass in the Arabian Sea, are either very weak or absent in the BoB. Similarly, nutrient inputs through river influx into the BoB are insufficient to enhance phytoplankton stock beyond the shelf waters. In this scenario, we showed here that the significantly larger spread of warm-core over the cold-core eddies is a simple ecological indicator of the basin-scale low phytoplankton stock in the BoB.},

Sensitivity experiments using an ocean general circulation model are carried out for this purpose in the Indian ocean around 65°–95°E, 5°–22°N during 1998–2014 (17 years). In the absence of near surface wind forcing, the sea surface temperature of the region greatly increases in all the seasons, whereas, in the absence of incoming shortwave radiation forcing, exactly opposite is the case. The sea surface salinity of the AS and BoB decreases in the absence of wind and shortwave radiation forcings, whereas, in the northern BoB it increases in the absence of freshwater flux forcing. The sub-surface changes in the stratification of temperature and salinity are also investigated. The influence of the air-sea forcings on the mixed layer depth of the region is found to be highly seasonally dependent. The effect of air-sea forcings on the seasonal variability of the upper ocean vertical stability is studied using the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity, buoyancy frequency, and energy required for mixing as quantifiers. The near surface wind forcing has highest contribution in changing the surface circulation of the region.},

@article{Parida2022,
abstract = {A 11-day time series of optical, physical and biological observations were collected from the southern Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon of 2016 as a part Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE). These observations were used to estimate Radiative Heating Rate (RHR) and to further understand its dependence on biological and physical variables. Initially, the water column was characterized by an oligotrophic condition with weak surface chlorophyll (chl-a) concentration (<0.1 mg m-3). During this period, the sky was clear, mixed layer was shallow and RHR reached up to 0.14 °C hr-1. Subsequently, the mixed layer deepened (60–70 m) and the surface chl-a concentration increased to 0.4 mg m-3. However, the sky was relatively cloudy (cloud index = 32%) and the RHR reduced to 0.01 °C hr-1 owing to reduced solar incidence. The observations suggest that the combined effect of physical and biological factors determine the RHR in the water column. A one-dimensional light penetration model simulations showed that the biological heating of 10 W m-2 would generate additional heating of 0.008 °C hr-1 in the upper ocean indicating significant impact of elevated chl-a concentration. These improved understanding of biophysical interaction in the Bay of Bengal will help to improve our knowledge about the chl-a induced feedbacks on sea surface temperature.},

abstract = {This study examines the effect of surface current in the bulk formula for the wind stress, referred to as the relative wind (RW) effect, on the energetics of the geostrophic circulation and the upper ocean stratification in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the summer monsoon seasons. When the RW effect is taken into account in the high-resolution SCOAR (WRF-ROMS) regional coupled model simulation and compared to the run without such a consideration, the kinetic energy both in the mean (MKE) and eddy (EKE) is reduced by more than a factor of two. The most significant reduction in the kinetic energy is found along the path of the northward East India Coastal Current (EICC) and to the south of its separated latitude. The energetics calculations and spectral analysis reveal that this significant damping of EKE is primarily due to reduced eddy wind work principally at wavelengths close to the first baroclinic Rossby deformation radius, indicating the modulation of the wind work by geostrophic mesoscale eddy fields. Moreover, the mixed layer depth (MLD) is significantly shoaled south of the separated EICC latitude, the area dominated by anticyclonic eddy activity. The shallower mixed layer and enhanced stratification with the RW effect are attributed to doming of the isopycnals by the anomalous upward Ekman velocity, which itself is generated by the interaction of anticyclonic mesoscale surface current and the prevailing southwesterly monsoonal wind. Overall, the geostrophic circulation and upper ocean stratification along the EICC and south of its separated latitude exhibit the most significant dynamical response. This result implies that this southwestern part of the BoB is a hot spot for the momentum exchange between the surface circulation and the monsoonal winds, thus a potential area for focused field measurements for the ocean circulation energetics and air-sea interaction.},

abstract = {The monsoon reversal winds in different seasons and high influx of freshwater from various rivers make the Bay of Bengal (BoB) a unique region. Thus, the knowledge of the dynamics of the mixed layer over this region is very important to assess the climatic variation of the Indian subcontinent. A comprehensive study of the role of external forcing on the seasonal and interannual mixed layer depth (MLD) variability over the BoB is carried out for 36 years (1980-2015) using reanalysis products. A weak and strong seasonality of MLD is observed over the northern and the southern BoB (NBoB and SBoB) respectively. The partial correlation suggests that the net heat flux (Qnet) is the major contributor to the deepening of MLD over the NBoB, whereas the wind stress controls the deepening over the SBoB. The seasonal variability reveals the deepening of MLD during summer and winter monsoon and the shallowing during pre- and post-monsoon over the BoB. The relation of the interannual MLD variability and the different phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) reveals that the negative phase of IOD is associated with deeper MLD over BoB while the positive phase of IOD depicts shallower MLD. In addition, the opposing characteristic of MLD is highly prominent during October-December. This is majorly contributed by variations related to the second downwelling Kelvin and associated Rossby waves over BoB for the opposing phases of the IOD years.},

abstract = {The thermal inversion (TI) is an interesting feature of the global ocean that plays a significant role in ocean-atmospheric process. This study addressed the spatial variability of the TI in the northern Bay of Bengal (NBoB) associated with mixed layer depth (MLD), isothermal layer depth (ILD), barrier layer thickness (BLT), and water mass formation in the winter season. Temperature, salinity, and density measurements were obtained via Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) casts from 12 different stations. The stations were divided into two regions: the north-western BoB (NW-BoB, 89.5°E: 90.5°E; 21.1°N to 21.6°N), and the north-eastern BoB (NE-BoB, 91°E to 92.1°E; 20.5°N to 21.2°N). Average profiles of the NW-BoB had deeper mixed layer (MLD of 10.30 m) and isothermal layer (ILD of 8.40 m) than profiles in the NE-BoB. The barrier layer in the NW-BoB was also thicker (2.79 m) than in the NE-BoB (1.05 m). One possible reason for these differences is the massive freshwater influx in the NW-BoB, as freshwater reduces salinity (27 PSU in the NW-BoB versus 35 PSU in the NE-BoB) and results in shallower MLD and ILD. Spatially organized TIs occurred in both the NE-BoB and NW-BoB during winter (January–February). Two distinct TI layers at 5 m and 28 m depth were visible in the NE-BoB to the formation of two water masses, the Bay of Bengal Low Salinity Water Mass and the Preparis Channel Water Mass. The NW-BoB featured only one TI layer at 8 m (with a inversion temperature of 0.58 °C), which was associated with the formation of one distinct water mass, the Bay of Bengal Intermediate Water Mass. Spatial variability of the TIs is a function of freshwater flux and surface cooling in the NBoB. More detailed investigation is needed to further understand the TIs and in the NBoB.},

This advection leads to the development of strong upper-ocean stratification (salinity stratification), which can have a significant impact on the evolution of SST and SSS by modifying mixing near the surface. In this study, we use a 1-dimensional (1-D) ocean mixing model (PWP) forced with in-situ air–sea fluxes from a surface mooring, along with estimates of horizontal surface freshwater and heat advection from a satellite ocean current product. We develop an ensemble of 1-D simulations by varying estimates of the advection used to force the model and analyze how the advection of temperature and salinity influences the evolution of SST and SSS. The use of an ensemble of solutions, rather than any single solution, compensates for uncertainty in our satellite estimates and significantly improves confidence in our results. Our results indicate that air–sea fluxes are not sufficient to properly simulate the evolution of SST in the northern Bay of Bengal, and that accounting for freshwater advection is required in order to reduce error in SST.},

abstract = {The present study investigates the impact of excess river runoff (eRR) and deficit river runoff (dRR) on the Bay of Bengal (BoB) upper ocean physics and circulation patterns using high resolution Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5) simulations. The ocean model MOM5 was forced by 3-hourly surface fluxes and interannual river runoff from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55). Sensitivity experiments are carried out with interannual and climatological river discharges from 1965 to 2016. Four positive river runoff anomaly years (1980, 1988, 1990, 2007) and four negative river runoff anomaly years (1979, 1986, 1992, 2009) during the satellite era, which are not influenced by the equatorial wind anomalies, are considered for the detailed analysis of eRR and dRR years. The study reveals that the distribution of salinity and the freshwater plume in eRR years differ significantly in the northern and western BoB from that of dRR years. The sea surface salinity difference is $\sim$2 psu in the northern BoB and the advection of freshwater by the southward East India Coastal Current (EICC) reaches the southern part of the BoB and enters the Arabian Sea in the eRR years. A strong cooling is observed in eRR years over the plume distributed area during post-monsoon and the excess freshwater amplifies the EICC as well. The large inflow of freshwater during eRR years is closely associated with a shallow mixed layer depth (MLD), formation of a thick barrier layer (BL), and strong circulation and temperature inversions, while the dRR years accumulate more heat compared to the eRR years in the upper 100 m of the plume area. This study, therefore, provides evidence for the impact of freshwater discharge on the BoB upper ocean processes. These may have a large impact on the local air-sea coupled processes and so representing accurate river discharge in climate models is crucial. It is also found that the EICC and the basin-wide cyclonic gyre advect the barrier layer along the Indian east coast into the southeastern Arabian Sea. This is one of the first studies to incorporate interannual runoff of all the major rivers flowing into the BoB in an ocean general circulation model for investigations of BoB processes.},

abstract = {The seasonal variations and driving mechanisms of the surface and subsurface chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Bay of Bengal are far from resolved, as only a few local, short-term studies have been performed. Hence, this study investigates a comprehensive basin-wide framework of the seasonal variations in the chlorophyll-a concentration, its dominant external forcing, and the internal dynamics of the Bay of Bengal. Multivariate empirical orthogonal function decomposition and heterogeneous correlation analyses are applied to numerous observational, reanalysis, and satellite datasets, including chlorophyll-a, nutrients, temperature, salinity, turbidity, and wind stress curl datasets collected from various sources, including the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, World Ocean Atlas, and ERA-Interim. This study suggests that the chlorophyll-a concentrations at both the surface and the subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum (SCM) are higher during summer and early autumn than during the other seasons, especially along the coastal regions and western part of the Bay of Bengal. During summer and early autumn, riverine nutrient inputs, the intrusion of nutritious water from the Arabian Sea, and coastal upwelling are the three dominant drivers controlling the chlorophyll-a concentrations at both the surface and the SCM. The positive wind stress curl-induced uplift of the thermocline increases the nutrient supply and thus significantly enhances the chlorophyll-a concentration at the SCM along the entire western side of the bay during the second half of the year. During spring, the deep euphotic depth plays a vital role in controlling the concentration and depth of the SCM. The depth of the 26 °C isotherm can be used as a proxy of the depth of the SCM. This study provides an improved understanding of the high chlorophyll-a concentrations and their drivers in five potential zones within the Bay of Bengal, which will help to identify the rich marine ecosystems therein.},

@article{Jain2021,
abstract = {Earlier studies suggest that the mixed-layer (ML) temperature or sea surface temperature (SST) of the Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon is determined primarily by air–sea fluxes. We use an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) to show that oceanic processes also play a significant role. Model heat-budget computations show that horizontal and vertical advection, constituting the direct role of dynamics, contribute significantly to the SST tendency in the western bay. The eastern limit of this direct-role regime is determined by downwelling Rossby waves, which are forced largely from the equatorial Indian Ocean, but are modified by alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and Ekman pumping along their westward path across the bay. The current and, as a result, advection weaken behind the Rossby waves. To the east of the Rossby wavefront, the thermocline is deep, permitting a deeper ML, but the actual ML depth (MLD) depends on the wind speed, with salinity also playing a role in the northern bay. Yet, there is negligible change in the SST even when MLD changes significantly because the deep thermocline decouples the changes in MLD and SST. In contrast, the shallower thermocline in the western bay limits the potential MLD, leading to larger changes in SST. The upwelling (downwelling) Rossby wave essentially conditions the upper ocean by decreasing (increasing) the potential depth of the mixed layer. SST variation weakens only when the thermocline deepens during downwelling events, which occur later in the western bay because Rossby waves propagate westward. The significant, but subtle, role of the Rossby waves in decoupling the changes in MLD and SST via downwelling is indirect, unlike the direct role of advection estimated in a standard heat-budget computation, and has been largely ignored in earlier studies.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) upper ocean circulation and thermohaline structure to varying wind strengths and river salinity conditions is investigated using a set of long-term mesoscale simulations. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations differ in their forcing fields for winds (strong vs. weak) and in their representations of river input salinity conditions (seasonally varying estuarine salinity vs. zero salinity). The sensitivities are analyzed in terms of the responses of the surface circulation, thermohaline structure, freshwater plume dispersion, and the coastal upwelling along the western boundary. All the simulations reproduce the main broad-scale features of the Bay, while their magnitudes and variabilities depend on the forcing conditions. The impact of stronger wind is felt at greater depths for temperature than for salinity throughout the domain; however, the impact is realized with vertical distributions that are different in the northern than in the southern Bay. As expected, the stronger wind-induced enhanced mixing lowers (enhances) the upper ocean temperature (salinity) by 0.2 °C (0.3 psu), and weakens the near-surface stratification. Moreover, stronger wind enhances eddy activity, strengthens the springtime Western Boundary Current (WBC) and enhances coastal upwelling during spring and summer along the east coast of India. The fresher river input reduces the surface salinity and hence enhances the spreading and intensity of the freshwater plume, stratification, and barrier layer thickness. The lower salinity simulation leads to an eddy-dominant springtime WBC, and enhances the freshness, strength, and southward extent of the autumn East India Coastal Current (EICC). The stronger wind simulations appear to prevent the spreading of the freshwater plume during the summer monsoon due to enhanced mixing. Fresher river input reduces the overall surface salinity by $\sim$0.4 psu; however, it significantly underestimates the salinity near the river mouths, whereas the estuarine salinity river input simulations are closer to reality. These results highlight the importance of river input salinity and realistic strong winds in reducing model biases of high-resolution simulations for the Bay of Bengal.},

@article{Shroyer2020,
abstract = {The Bay of Bengal is forced by the South Asian monsoon and associated seasonally reversing winds and freshwater fluxes. Here, we summarize a high-resolution, basin-wide survey of the Bay of Bengal conducted during the 2013 northeast (winter) monsoon. The observed mixed layer waters were sourced from the eastern Bay; and, generally, the upper ocean temperature-salinity properties followed regional trends as determined by Argo. Intense lateral mixed layer gradients were seen throughout the Bay. The majority of the observed fronts were salinity-controlled with compensating temperature gradients. Similarly, salinity was typically the primary control on the vertical density stratification near the mixed layer depth. In contrast to the shallow, sharp halocline, temperature stratification was enhanced over a larger depth range with the base of the near-surface isothermal layer often located beneath the mixed layer, indicating the presence of a barrier layer. Finescale layers in vertical temperature and salinity stratification were traced over distances greater than 100 km in the horizontal. Within a $\sim$week-long period, we observed a significant reduction in the intensity of gradients (both lateral and vertical) as well as a shift in the relative importance of salinity in setting the observed gradients. By the end of the 17-day cruise when the ship was in the southern Bay of Bengal, temperature was an equal or dominant contributor to lateral and vertical gradients. Stratification and mixed layer fronts evolved over a relatively short time scale, likely in response to strong atmospheric forcing either associated with a tropical cyclone, sustained northeast monsoon conditions, or a combination of the two. Resolution of the observed lateral gradients requires sampling at lateral scales O(1km) or smaller, suggestive of the importance of the submesoscale.},

abstract = {The mixed layer depth is directly affected by natural processes in the atmosphere. Mixed layer depth in the Andaman Sea was analyzed based on salinity data from the 3-dimensional model from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. Seasonal signals are formed to identify the number of mixed layer depth seasons in a year. Wind, precipitation, temperature, and salinity performance analysis were performed using a monthly average value for 26 years. Based on the results, mixed layer depth differences in the Andaman Sea are influenced by wind and precipitation. The wind has a direct impact on mixed layer depth. The wind strength affects simultaneously as mixed layer depth conditions. Precipitation shows an indirect impact on mixed layer depth. Precipitation takes time to accumulate effect to change the state of mixed layer depth. The time required for precipitation is two months before the change in the mixed layer depth occurs. The mixed layer depth has two seasons annually, and the more significant season occurs in April as the lowest point and July as the deepest point. In the other season, October has a moderately shallow depth, and January has a moderately deep depth. The average differences in temperature and salinity in the surface layer and the mixed layer were 0.1266 °C and 0.2477 practical salinity units.},

@article{Kumar2019,
abstract = {Widespread SST cooling (1.5–2 °C) of the Bay of Bengal occurred in response to cyclone Roanu 2016, a weak, pre-monsoon storm. We investigate this using data from a Lagrangian float, measuring temperature, salinity and velocity profiles in the upper 80 m, supplemented by 3 Argo floats. At the Lagrangian float, cooling was primarily due to mixing of the warm (32 °C), fresh cap formed during the previous months of light winds and clear skies, accounting for about half of the cooling. Air-sea heat fluxes played a secondary role, accounting for about a quarter of the cooling. The depth of mixing was diagnosed by two measures: a traditional mixed layer depth and a “mixing depth” defined as the deepest depth unstable to shear instability. The mixing depth was roughly twice ($\sim$65 m) the mixed layer depth ($\sim$35 m), illustrating the importance of the “transition layer” between them. The mixed layer restratified into 2 layers within a day after the end of the storm with near-inertial frequency waves gented by the storm increasing the diapycnal mixing rates at the depth of the transition layer to about 10−4 m2s−1. A popular upper ocean mixing model (PWP) driven by heat, moisture and momentum fluxes from reanalysis products (ERA-5 and CCMP) reproduced the maximum mixed layer depth to within a meter; maximum mixing depth was underpredicted by 10 m. These results were insensitive to uncertainties in the air-sea forcing. The change in SST was underestimated by 0.7 °C and the model predicts few of the observed variations in mixed layer salinity. Some of these errors are due to uncertainties in air-sea fluxes, but lateral processes must also play a role, both during the storm and during the subsequent restratification. Data from the Argo floats, although much less detailed, show similar patterns with better simulations of mixed layer depth than of temperature and salinity evolution. Large-scale models generally underestimate the stratification of the upper 50 m of the Bay of Bengal leading to biases in modeling the important air-sea interactions that occur. These results suggest that although these errors may partially be due to errors in modelled vertical mixing rates, errors in modeling horizontal variability and its interaction with vertical mixing are also likely to be important.},

@article{Narvekar2006,
abstract = {Hydrographic data from National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) and Responsible National Oceanographic Data Centre (RNODC) were used to study the seasonal variability of the mixed layer in the central Bay of Bengal (8-20°N and 87-91°E), while meteorological data from Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) were used to explore atmospheric forcing responsible for the variability. The observed changes in the mixed-layer depth (MLD) clearly demarcated a distinct north-south regime with 15°N as the limiting latitude. North of this latitude MLD remained shallow (∼20 m) for most of the year without showing any appreciable seasonality. Lack of seasonality suggests that the low-salinity water, which is perennially present in the northern Bay, controls the stability and MLD. The observed winter freshening is driven by the winter rainfall and associated river discharge, which is advected offshore under the prevailing circulation. The resulting stratification was so strong that even a 4 °C cooling in sea-surface temperature (SST) during winter was unable to initiate convective mixing. In contrast, the southern region showed a strong semi-annual variability with deep MLD during summer and winter and a shallow MLD during spring and fall intermonsoons. The shallow MLD in spring and fall results from primary and secondary heating associated with increased incoming solar radiation and lighter winds during this period. The deep mixed layer during summer results from two processes: the increased wind forcing and the intrusion of high-salinity waters of Arabian Sea origin. The high winds associated with summer monsoon initiate greater wind-driven mixing, while the intrusion of high-salinity waters erodes the halocline and weakens the upper-layer stratification of the water column and aids in vertical mixing. The deep MLD in the south during winter was driven by wind-mixing, when the upper water column was comparatively less stable. The deep MLD between 15 and 17°N during March-May cannot be explained in the context of local atmospheric forcing. We show that this is associated with the propagation of Rossby waves from the eastern Bay. We also show that the nitrate and chlorophyll distribution in the upper ocean during spring intermonsoon is strongly coupled to the MLD, whereas during summer river runoff and cold-core eddies appear to play a major role in regulating the nutrients and chlorophyll. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The effects of horizontal discretization on linear baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are investigated by analyzing the behavior of the hydrostatic Eady problem in ocean models on the B and C grids. On the C grid a spurious baroclinic instability appears at small wavelengths. This instability does not disappear as the grid scale decreases; instead, it simply moves to smaller horizontal scales. The peak growth rate of the spurious instability is independent of the grid scale as the latter decreases. It is equal to cf/Ri where Ri is the balanced Richardson number, f is the Coriolis parameter, and c is a nondimensional constant that depends on the Richardson number. As the Richardson number increases c increases towards an upper bound of approximately 1/2; for large Richardson numbers the spurious instability is faster than the Eady instability. To suppress the spurious instability it is recommended to use fourth-order centered tracer advection along with biharmonic viscosity and diffusion with coefficients ($\Delta$x)4f/(32Ri) or larger where $\Delta$x is the grid scale. On the B grid, the growth rates of baroclinic and symmetric instabilities are too small, and converge upwards towards the correct values as the grid scale decreases; no spurious instabilities are observed. In B grid models at eddy-permitting resolution, the reduced growth rate of baroclinic instability may contribute to partially-resolved eddies being too weak. On the C grid the growth rate of symmetric instability is better (larger) than on the B grid, and converges upwards towards the correct value as the grid scale decreases.},

abstract = {Although the performance of the high-resolution global ocean forecasting system, which is based on First Institute of Oceanography surface wave-tide-circulation coupled ocean model (FIO-COM) has been demonstrated to have reasonable accuracy in global context, especially in tropical oceans and some special cases, the assessment needs to be extended in different parts of the global oceans. As such, given the significance of a regional Ocean Forecasting System (OFS) in the world's prominent freshwater dominated basin, the northern Bay of Bengal, a groundwork is crucial for the modeling community. Thus, performance of FIO-COM analysis and forecasting results is assessed by utilizing available moored buoy, satellite, and reanalysis datasets. The present study compares the thermohaline structure related variables (e.g., temperature, salinity) from FIO-COM with aforementioned datasets on a seasonal and daily basis. We focused on evaluating the FIO-COM outputs during a very severe cyclonic storm named Titli that formed in October, 2018. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for sea surface temperature (SST) ranges from 0.47 to 0.71 °C, and for sea surface salinity from 0.62 to 0.83 psu; while vertical profile RMSE ranges from 0.27 to 1.0 °C for temperature, and 0.22 to 0.56 psu for salinity between FIO-COM products and observations. Daily variations in different thermohaline structure related variables at two RAMA positions are also well captured by the FIO-COM outputs. Both model and satellite data show pronounced SST cooling (approximately 2.0–2.5 °C) and increased sea surface salinity ($\sim$ 1 psu) on the right side of the cyclone track. High SST, TCHP and deep isothermal layer depth were the main oceanic triggering forces to intensify the cyclone Titli.},

abstract = {Reconstruction projects after the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004 were typically contracted out to implementing partners or government agencies. One of the few projects directly implemented by the Body of Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BRR) was funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help reestablish fisheries. During the course of the project, 151 GPS-enabled depth sounders with data-logging devices were installed on various types of artisanal fishing boats engaged in the different types of fishing strategies in Aceh such as purse-seine, drop-line, long-line, and gill net fishing. These devices were configured to automatically record time, position, speed, water depth, and sea surface temperature (SST) every time the boat moved 30 m. This study examines the relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) and the net deployment (ND) of traditional purse seine fishers. The data consists of 922 data sets (6,170,648 data points) collected from 45 purse seine boats between June 2007 and May 2009. Among the data, 1,619 data points indicated the total number of ND; the nets were deployed only when schools of fish were actually sighted. The results indicate that the most frequent SST for ND is 28–28.5°C±0.1365°C with a mean standard error of 0.0117% in a 95% confidence interval. This study has demonstrated that the data gathered from the fishermen (community-based approach) has near-real-time character and, consequently, is an important source for the monitoring and managing of the local fish stocks.},

abstract = {The research was conducted by considering the values of temperature, mixed layer depth (MLD) as a result of the analysis, and sea-level winds in the waters of North Aceh. MLD was analyzed from the results of the three-dimensional Copernicus marine environment monitoring service (CMEMS) model, which has been validated with sea surface temperature (SST) data from the monthly Aqua MODIS. The results show that SST CMEMS is relatively the same as SST Aqua MODIS with variations up to 2°C. The verification of SST CMEMS data for February, April, August and October showed quite good results with a correlation value of r = 0.8523. Analysis in February, August, and October shows MLD is deepest. MLD in Aceh's northern waters is 68-91 meters, and Sabang and Krueng Raya waters are 68-79 meters. However, MLD is at its most shallow in April. The waters of North Aceh is 49 meters, Sabang waters is 40 meters, and Krueng Raya is 9 meters. In February, the wind speed occurs in the northeast wind direction with a speed of 3.2 m/s. April and October occur in the direction of the transitional monsoon. The wind speed in April is 2.2 m/s, and October is 2.9 m/s. The southwest wind direction is 4.1 m/s in October. From these results, the influence of the monsoon wind is enormous in the waters of northern Aceh.},
